const has a block scope, CANNOT be redeclared

Why can I change a constant object (array) in javascript ???

When you're adding to an array or object you're not re-assigning or re-declaring the constant, it's already declared and assigned, you're just adding to the "list" that the constant points to.

So this works fine:

const x = {};

x.foo = 'bar';

console.log(x); // {foo : 'bar'}

x.foo = 'bar2';

console.log(x); // {foo : 'bar2'}

//ES6 classes( can only be used from version 6 of javascript)

class Person {
  constructor(name, address) {
    this.name = name;
    this.address = address;
  }
  getAddress() {
    return "I live in " + this.address;
  }
}
const test = new Person("Hoi Dan IT", "Ha Noi");
console.log(">>>Check test: ", test);
console.log(">>>Check test: ", test.getAddress());
